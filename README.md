## Description

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)'s [`distraction free mode`](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/distraction_free.html) but not full-screen!
A windowed UI is more manageable and accessible, yet it can be simple and sublime!

DistractionFreeWindow was inspired by [this forum post](https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/non-fullscreen-distraction-free-mode/12343).


## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
   Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
       ],
   ```
1. And,
   change it to the following, i.e.,
   put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
   ```
   * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
     you will not install this forked version of the package,
     but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,
   go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
search for **`DistractionFreeWindow`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

## Usage

Use the keybinding `Super+F11` to toggle DistractionFreeWindow mode.

### Changing Layout

Users of the [`MaxPane`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MaxPane) plug-in will appreciate that [`DistractionFreeWindow`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/DistractionFreeWindow) directly integrates with it and simplifies the layout when you go into **DistractionFreeWindow mode** and restores the layout after comming back out of it.

## Customization

### Settings

DistractionFreeWindow inherits `distraction free mode` settings from the core application.
You can set these via `Preferences > Settings - Distraction Free`, compare the official docs:

<https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/distraction_free.html>

### Key Bindings

You can adjust the default key binding <kbd>Super</kbd><kbd>F11</kbd> via `Preferences > Package Settings > DistractionFreeWindow > Key Bindings` from the main menu.
