The DistractionFreeWindow package gives you the ability to use Sublime Text's
`distraction free mode` but not full-screen! A windowed UI is more manageable
and accessible, yet it can be simple and sublime!

The default keyboard shortcut is `Super + F11`.

DistractionFreeWindow integrates directly with the MaxPane package.
